# Welcome to Daniel Hochman's programmer portfolio

This is a GitHub account I've set up for the purpose of showcasing my programming projects. It contains both finished projects as well as projects that I am currently working on. Some of the projects here are private repositories, so I've included login credentials on my resume for you to login with in order to access these projects.
