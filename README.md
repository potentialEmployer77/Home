# Welcome to Daniel Hochman's programmer portfolio

This is a GitHub account I've set up for the purpose of showcasing my programming projects. Here, you will find both finished projects as well as projects that I am currently working on. As most of the projects are private repositories, I've included login credentials at the top my resume for you to login with in order to access these projects (if you're interesting in looking at the source code and/or the commit history).

Currently, I have three projects that I am excited to showcase and talk to you about:

1). [OsMowSis](https://github.com/potentialEmployer77/OsMowSisHome): A simulation program of an automated lawn-mowing system whereby a cohort of robotic lawn mowers is placed on a lawn and must scan and move around the lawn in order to cut all the grass, while also avoiding crashing into various types of obstacles on the lawn. This project was written in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit.

* Short video demonstration available [here](https://youtu.be/65dBQBcDRs4).

2). [SpotBook](https://github.com/potentialEmployer77/SpotBookHome): An Android app for storing, organizing, and sharing “spots” (places of interest). Combines geo-data, textual data, and media into a single cohesive entity (a “spot”). Solves a common limitation of existing apps (i.e., GoogleMaps, GooglePhotos, etc.) which only allow users to maintain collections of either media, geo-data, or textual data, but not all three together. 
This app is currently being beta tested and can be downloaded through the following Firebase App Distribution [invitation link](https://youtu.be/jxqs0F_ICZM).

2). Compiler: A compiler written in Java for a small language.

Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you!
