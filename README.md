# Welcome to Daniel Hochman's programmer portfolio

This is a GitHub account I've set up for the purpose of showcasing my programming projects. Here, you will find both finished projects as well as projects that I am currently working on. As most of the projects are private repositories, I've included login credentials on my resume for you to login with in order to access these projects. 

Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
